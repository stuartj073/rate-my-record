## Testing User Stories

- As a user I want to access a website that allows me to review a record and/or a record store. 
The fundamental aspect of the website. To facilitate user's ability to review records they could do so by clicking on the 'Add a review' button on the top right hand side of the navbar menu. They could then choose to either rate a record or rate a store.

- As a user I want the site to make sense upon my initial point of entry to it.
My aim from the layout I put forward for the landing page was to capture the essence of the site in as seamless a manner possible. I feel the combination of the cover image, along with the slogan as well as the reviews just underneath work to bring the ethos of the website almost immediately to potential users.

The user can achieve this by clicking on the 'edit' button which is located on any review of which they have created themselves.

A search bar is located just underneath the cover image to the site

A delete button is available for all reviews made by the user in question.

- As a user I would like to be able to contact the site owner(s) over any issues/improvements that I see fit to further my experience on the website.
At the bottom of the page, a logged in user may access the 'contact' page where they can voice their opinion to the admin of the site.

- As admin, I would like to mediate over all user's actions.
If the user is admin they will have access to two extra pages which facilitate content moderation and who can contribute to it. 

![control](static/images/control.png)

- As admin I want to ensure that user's are enjoying their experience as much as possible and ensure the website is as responsive to a mobile user as it is to a desktop user.
Ensuring a site is responsive is tantamount to maximising user experience on the website. I ensured that users of all screensizes would have have access to the full experience of RateMyRecord.
