# Rate My Record

In line with the criteria for the third milestone project I have chosen to adopt the first route in developing my own idea and bringing it to life. The idea chosen meets all CRUD criteria in making the dynamic website function and allows visitors to sign up/sign in at any given point of their own choosing.
The idea is quite simple. The website is a review sharing site which allows users to comment on specific albums/records/singles as well as record stores themselves. On their own profile page, user’s can view the reviews they’ve made in the past as well as editing them. They can also add reviews from other users to their own page using the ‘add to wishlist’ button displayed on reviews made from others on the landing page. Going with these features is the ability a user has to remove their own review as well as those from their wish list. 
The purpose of the website is to give user’s the chance to acquire and learn about new music/record stores they would’ve been unfamiliar with. The database is utilised in such a way as to prompt users into discovering new things and potentially providing some knowledge of their own musical taste. 
Going forward with this project, I would ideally like to allow user’s to interact with one another and to facilitate an online marketplace for the buying and selling of vinyl records.

## UX/UI

### Landing Page

As stated in the above user stories, I want the main message of the site to become known to the user upon entering the website. When a user clicks on to the site, they will be greeted by a large cover photo with a backgdrop image of vinyl records. The banner presiding over the image reads: "Rate My Record.. A place for like-minded music lovers to contribute". Below it are two options allowing a first time visitor the option to register or a current user the chance to log back in. Below this (if a user is logged in) section is a search bar allowing user's to look for anything they are interested in. Following underneath the search bar are the various record and record store reviews left by user's registered on the website. Each part is accompanied with headings and each review is given it's own 'review-card'.

As to ensure the banner is as clear as possible over the site cover image I decided to make it right in the middle of the image, with a white background in order to facilitate an easy to read black color for the content of the page banner. The headings for the page are exactly 50% in width and have a '#a1887f'/brownish sort color along with a '#e0e0e0' border. Review cards are shown in rows of two on large screens and one by one on smaller devices. Again, the coloring is quite straightforward as to not produce color overload to the user(s) with a white background and black color for the content. Images for the reviews are shown as either the image provided by the user or else the default image as seen in the if statement for the image section in profile.html.

The background color to the website was chosen as '#d7ccc8'. I chose it as I felt that it allowed all corresponding elements and their colors to mix well with one another and it proved to project the main message of the website easily, accessibly and neatly.
